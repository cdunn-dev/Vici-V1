## Replit AI Agent, I need your help!

I'm having trouble getting my server to start on Replit. My database is set up correctly, but something's not right with the server itself.

Here's the error message I'm seeing: `[2025-03-04T11:06:02.108Z] [ERROR] Failed to initialize application: - {}`

Can you help me figure out what's going wrong and get my server running?

**Here's what I need you to do:**

1. **Dig into the error logs:**
   * Take a close look at the error message I provided and any other logs Replit is giving me.
   * See if you can spot any hints about why the server isn't starting.
   * Notice that the error message doesn't have much detail (the `{}` part).

2. **Help me simplify things:**
   * Suggest ways to make my server startup code simpler so I can find the problem area.
   * Maybe I should start with just the bare minimum code and add things back in one by one?

3. **Check my dependencies:**
   * How can I be sure all the things my project needs are installed correctly and working together?
   * Should I look at my `package.json` file? What about running `npm install` again?

4. **Make sure my environment variables are right:**
   * Remind me to double-check all the environment variables my project needs (except for `DATABASE_URL`, which is already set).

5. **Anything Replit-specific I should know?**
   * Are there any common server problems on Replit, or any special settings I need?
   * Should I check the Replit docs?

6. **If we're still stuck:**
   * If we try a few things and the server still won't start, what should I do? Should I undo some of my recent changes?
   * Is there a way to get help from Replit or other users?

**My goal is to:**

* Figure out exactly why my server isn't starting.
* Get clear steps to fix the problem.
* Have a working server on Replit!

**Here's some more info about my project:**

* **Project Type:** Node.js with Express and React
* **Programming Language:** TypeScript
* **Database Type:** I'm using the built-in Replit database

Thanks for your help, Replit AI Agent! I'm looking forward to getting this sorted out.
