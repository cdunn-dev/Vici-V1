Strava Integration
The current setup of the Strava integration in strava.ts has several potential areas for improvement:
1. Error Handling and Logging:
More informative error messages: Instead of generic error messages, include specific details like the HTTP status code, error type, and the request that caused the error. This will make debugging easier.
Centralized error handling: Consider using a centralized error handling mechanism to catch and log errors consistently across all functions. This could involve a custom error class or a logging service.
Verbose logging: Increase logging verbosity to include request and response details (excluding sensitive data) for debugging purposes.
2. Security:
Secure storage of tokens: Avoid storing access and refresh tokens directly in the database. Instead, use a secure storage mechanism like encryption or a secrets manager.
Token expiration handling: Implement robust token refresh logic to ensure that expired tokens are automatically refreshed before making API calls.
Input validation: Validate user inputs and API responses to prevent potential security vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
3. Efficiency and Scalability:
Rate limiting: Strava has API rate limits. Implement rate limiting handling to avoid exceeding these limits and ensure your application remains functional.
Background processing: Consider moving long-running tasks like syncing Strava activities to a background queue to avoid blocking the main thread and improve responsiveness.
Caching: Cache frequently accessed data like athlete information or activity summaries to reduce API calls and improve performance.
4. Code Structure and Maintainability:
Modularization: Break down the code into smaller, more manageable modules with clear responsibilities. This will improve code organization and readability.
Code comments: Add more detailed comments to explain the logic and purpose of different code sections.
Unit tests: Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual functions and components.
5. User Experience:
Progress indicators: Provide feedback to the user during long-running operations like syncing activities.
Error handling in UI: Display informative error messages to the user in the UI and provide guidance on how to resolve issues.
Specific Code Suggestions:
In exchangeStravaCode:
Log the full error response for debugging.
Consider using a more specific error type than Error.
In syncStravaActivities:
Handle potential errors during activity insertion more gracefully.
Consider using a more efficient way to check for existing activities, such as using a unique constraint on the stravaId column in the database.
By addressing these issues, you can improve the reliability, security, and maintainability of the Strava integration in your application.
