While we're in unit testing mode, can we run unit tests on all of the following to identify issues/errors?

Server-side:
server/services/strava.ts:

Test getStravaAuthUrl to ensure it generates the correct authentication URL with the appropriate parameters.
Test exchangeStravaCode to ensure it correctly exchanges the authorization code for access and refresh tokens.
Test refreshStravaToken to ensure it successfully refreshes expired tokens.
Test syncStravaActivities to ensure it correctly fetches and stores Strava activities, handles existing activities, and updates the database accordingly.
server/services/ai/openai.ts:
Test makeRequest to ensure it correctly sends requests to the OpenAI API and handles responses and errors.
Test generateTrainingPlan, analyzeWorkout, and generateAdjustments to ensure they construct the correct prompts and process the AI responses appropriately.
server/services/training-plan-generator.ts:
Test the functions responsible for generating training plans based on user preferences and AI responses.
server/auth.ts:
Test the authentication functions to ensure they correctly handle user login, registration, and session management.
Client-side:
client/src/components/training/plan-generator.tsx:
Test the form validation logic to ensure it correctly handles user inputs and provides feedback.
Test the interaction with the server-side API to ensure it sends the correct data and handles responses appropriately.
client/src/components/training/plan-preview.tsx:
Test the rendering of training plans based on data received from the server.
Test the user interactions, such as editing workouts or weeks.
client/src/pages/training.tsx:
Test the overall functionality of the training page, including fetching and displaying training plans, handling user interactions, and managing state.
Testing Frameworks:

Jest: A popular JavaScript testing framework with built-in mocking and assertion capabilities.
React Testing Library: A library for testing React components that encourages testing from the user's perspective.
