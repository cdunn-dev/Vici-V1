# Vici-V1 Documentation Maintenance Guide

This guide outlines the process for maintaining documentation for the Vici-V1 project to ensure it remains accurate, up-to-date, and useful for all stakeholders.

## Documentation Maintenance Principles

1. **Documentation is Code**: Treat documentation with the same care and attention as code.
2. **Living Documentation**: Documentation should evolve with the codebase.
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Maintain one authoritative source for each piece of information.
4. **Accessibility**: Documentation should be accessible to all team members.
5. **Review Process**: Documentation changes should go through a review process similar to code changes.

## Documentation Update Process

### 1. When to Update Documentation

Documentation should be updated in the following scenarios:

- When new features are added
- When existing features are modified
- When bugs are fixed that affect documented behavior
- When deployment procedures change
- When infrastructure configurations change
- When security policies are updated
- When dependencies are updated
- When APIs are modified

### 2. Documentation Review Checklist

Before submitting documentation changes, ensure:

- [ ] All information is accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Technical details are correct
- [ ] Code examples are tested and working
- [ ] Commands can be executed without errors
- [ ] Screenshots reflect the current UI
- [ ] Links to other documentation are valid
- [ ] Formatting is consistent with other documentation
- [ ] Grammar and spelling are correct
- [ ] No sensitive information is included
- [ ] Changes are properly versioned

### 3. Documentation Review Process

1. **Create a Documentation Issue**:
   - Create an issue in the project repository
   - Label it with the "documentation" tag
   - Assign it to the appropriate team member

2. **Make Documentation Changes**:
   - Create a branch for the documentation changes
   - Make the necessary updates
   - Test any code examples or commands
   - Commit changes with a descriptive message

3. **Submit for Review**:
   - Create a pull request for the documentation changes
   - Link the pull request to the documentation issue
   - Request reviews from at least one team member

4. **Review and Feedback**:
   - Reviewers should check for accuracy, clarity, and completeness
   - Provide specific feedback on any issues
   - Approve the changes when satisfied

5. **Merge and Deploy**:
   - Merge the approved changes into the main branch
   - Deploy the updated documentation
   - Close the documentation issue

## Documentation Structure

The Vici-V1 documentation is organized as follows:

```
docs/
├── architecture/         # Architectural decisions and patterns
├── api/                  # API documentation and references
├── implementation/       # Technical implementation details
├── guides/               # User and developer guides
└── README.md             # Documentation overview
```

### Documentation Types

1. **Architecture Documentation**:
   - System architecture
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Component interactions
   - Design decisions and rationale

2. **API Documentation**:
   - API endpoints
   - Request/response formats
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting
   - Error handling

3. **Implementation Documentation**:
   - Code organization
   - Key classes and functions
   - Algorithms and data structures
   - Configuration options

4. **User Guides**:
   - Getting started
   - Installation
   - Configuration
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting

5. **Developer Guides**:
   - Development environment setup
   - Coding standards
   - Testing procedures
   - Deployment process
   - Contribution guidelines

## Documentation Tools and Standards

### 1. Markdown

All documentation is written in Markdown format with the following standards:

- Use ATX-style headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Use fenced code blocks with language specification
- Use tables for structured data
- Use lists for sequential steps or related items
- Use emphasis (`*italic*`, `**bold**`) sparingly

### 2. Diagrams

Diagrams should be created using:

- [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and entity relationship diagrams
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) for UML diagrams
- SVG or PNG for custom diagrams

### 3. Code Examples

Code examples should:

- Be complete and executable
- Include comments explaining complex parts
- Follow project coding standards
- Be tested before inclusion
- Include expected output where relevant

### 4. Versioning

Documentation should be versioned to match the application releases:

- Tag documentation with the same version numbers as the application
- Maintain a changelog for documentation updates
- Archive outdated documentation for reference

## Automated Documentation Validation

### 1. Markdown Linting

Use [markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint) to ensure consistent formatting:

```bash
# Install markdownlint
npm install -g markdownlint-cli

# Run markdownlint on all documentation
markdownlint 'docs/**/*.md'
```

### 2. Link Checking

Use [markdown-link-check](https://github.com/tcort/markdown-link-check) to verify all links are valid:

```bash
# Install markdown-link-check
npm install -g markdown-link-check

# Check links in a specific file
markdown-link-check docs/guides/deployment.md
```

### 3. Code Example Testing

Use [mdsh](https://github.com/zimbatm/mdsh) to test code examples in documentation:

```bash
# Install mdsh
gem install mdsh

# Test code examples in a specific file
mdsh docs/guides/deployment.md
```

## Documentation Review Schedule

Regular documentation reviews should be scheduled:

1. **Quarterly Full Review**:
   - Review all documentation for accuracy and completeness
   - Update outdated information
   - Add missing documentation
   - Remove obsolete documentation

2. **Monthly Quick Review**:
   - Review recently updated documentation
   - Check for broken links
   - Verify code examples still work
   - Update screenshots if UI has changed

3. **Pre-Release Review**:
   - Review all documentation affected by the release
   - Update version numbers
   - Add release notes
   - Update migration guides if needed

## Documentation Feedback Process

1. **Collect Feedback**:
   - Encourage users to provide feedback on documentation
   - Create a feedback form or issue template
   - Monitor documentation-related issues

2. **Analyze Feedback**:
   - Categorize feedback by type (accuracy, clarity, completeness)
   - Prioritize feedback based on impact and frequency
   - Identify patterns in common issues

3. **Address Feedback**:
   - Create documentation issues for feedback items
   - Assign issues to appropriate team members
   - Track resolution of feedback items

4. **Communicate Updates**:
   - Notify users when their feedback has been addressed
   - Highlight documentation improvements in release notes
   - Thank users for their feedback

## Documentation Maintenance Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| **Documentation Lead** | Overall documentation strategy, review schedule, standards |
| **Developers** | Update documentation with code changes, review documentation PRs |
| **Technical Writers** | Create and maintain user-facing documentation, ensure clarity |
| **DevOps Engineers** | Maintain operational documentation, deployment guides |
| **QA Engineers** | Review documentation for accuracy, test code examples |

## Conclusion

Maintaining accurate and up-to-date documentation is essential for the success of the Vici-V1 project. By following these guidelines, we ensure that our documentation remains a valuable resource for all team members and stakeholders.

Remember: Good documentation is not just about writing—it's about maintaining a living resource that evolves with the project.
