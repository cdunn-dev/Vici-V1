# Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for individual components and functions.

## Structure

- `components/` - Tests for React components
- `hooks/` - Tests for custom React hooks
- `utils/` - Tests for utility functions
- `api/` - Tests for API endpoints

## Running Tests

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

## Guidelines

- Each test file should correspond to a source file
- Follow the naming convention: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`
- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Keep tests focused and isolated
